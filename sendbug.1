.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIsendbug\fR program assists a user in filling out an accurate bug
report by providing a template to fill out, with hardware and version
information already inserted.  The user is prompted for the name of
the program the bug is in, unless it is given as a command line
argument.  The user is then given the chance to edit the bug report
with their default editor.  Once filled out, it is sent to "bugs@MIT.EDU".
