.SH NAME
sendbug \- file a bug report

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
sendbug
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIsendbug\fR program assists a user in filling out an accurate bug
report by providing a template to fill out, with hardware and version
information already inserted, and prompting them for the name of the program
the bug is in.  The user is then given the chance to edit the bug report
with their default editor under the MH system.  Once filled out, it is sent
to "bugs@MIT.EDU".

.SH "SEE ALSO"

.SH BUGS
The default editor specified by the EDITOR or VISUAL environment variable
should be used, instead of the default editor under MH, which is controlled
by a separate configuration file.
